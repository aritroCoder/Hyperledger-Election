# Hyperledger-Election

This is a proof of concept where we implement a simple election setup where we can add candidates, voters and vote for them, and later, publish the result. This is meant to be a Hyperledger version of the election smart contract I created for ethereum: https://github.com/aritroCoder/ethereum-voting-system


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aritroCoder/Hyperledger-Election
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd election-smart-contract
```

Most of the instructions to run locally are given in the hyperledger documentation: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html. Download the `fabric-samples` into PC to use the `test-network` script provided, and follow instructions of the docs.
